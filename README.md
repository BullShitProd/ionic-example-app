# Ionic 2 Examples

A collection of ionic 2 examples. Usage of plugins etc. 

If you want to request an example you can create a issue for it. I do this in my free time so I can not promise to do every request.

See the README files in each folder for more information per example.

It got to my attention that the examples aren't up-to-date. I'll update as soon as I find the time to do it.

I can however say that the image-picker is now native. So you need that will the examples work. You can find the native ionic plugin [here](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/native/image-picker/).

Thanks for the heads up [Rodrigo Rubio](https://github.com/rrubio?tab=activity)
